Macspeak is a very basic app to allow you to have your computer talk, or remote into another app and make it talk.

It is great for scaring my kids when they have headphones on and are zoned into some game.

This was also just a fun way to learn about creating Electron apps.

I'm sure there are lots of ways this could be improved such as:

* Use ssh key for authentication
* Save remote machine auth settings
* Store multiple auth settings
* Get volume before and set back to original after speaking

If you want to play around and add any of these features, please do and submit a merge request.
